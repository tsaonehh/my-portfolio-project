# my-portfolio-project
this project is all me and all about me,
this is your first introduction of me really.
it's obviously a little bias since i am the one who wrote it but still,
its pretty accurate information.
My main objective is to showcase all my
amazing works (such as with my Photo Drag & Drop App) through this portfolio,
so that potential clients and employees
can see what I can do.
And hopefully you get to know me a little 
better too as a person.
